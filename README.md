# Cross-chain swap using LayerZero

This repo is meant to serve as the corresponding codebase to this blog I published on Developer Dao's blog.

You can check out the code for a cross-chain swap in the `src` directory. The deployment scripts are in the `script` directory.

The blog contains a detailed walkthrough of everything you need to do to set up a swap like this.
This swap will exchange ETH for MATIC, and vice-versa at a fixed 1:1 price.

Stupid I know, but I wanted to keep things as simple as possible.
